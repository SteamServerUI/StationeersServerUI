## üëµ What Are These Ancient Relics?

Welcome, digital archaeologist! You've stumbled upon the fossilized remains of earlier Stationeers Server UI versions. These branches are preserved primarily for historical documentation, developer nightmares, and occasionally making @JacksonTheMaster cry.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE ‚ö†Ô∏è

### These branches are about as functional as a teapot in summer.

**SERIOUSLY, GO DOWNLOAD THE [LATEST RELEASE](https://github.com/JacksonTheMaster/StationeersServerUI/releases/latest) INSTEAD.**

Old branches will attempt to download files that have long since moved on to the great repository in the sky. They're maintained purely for:

1. Historical reference
2. Code archaeology
3. Developer nostalgia
4. The following (sigh):

## ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "But I REALLY Need This Specific Old Version!"

Are you absolutely, positively sure? Fine. Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Clone this specific branch
2. Edit `src/config/config.Branch` to match your current branch name
3. Build using:
   - For ancient versions: `go run build.go`
   - For slightly less ancient versions: `go run build/build.go`
4. Accept that you are now on your own personal journey of pain and probably fixing already fixed bugs

## üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è "I'm Still Going To Try This!"

Congratulations on your determination! When things go sideways (not if, WHEN), please follow these steps:

1. Acknowledge your choices
2. Download the latest release instead
3. Pretend this never happened

## üìú Historical Context

These branches are NOT maintained and exist only for continuity of development history and historical reference. They represent the evolutionary path that led to the current codebase, much like how chickens evolved from dinosaurs. Do I like dinosaurs? Maybe.

## ü§° Support Policy

Support for these branches is provided on a "point and laugh" basis only. 

My official, heartfelt recommendation is:

```
$ rm -rf old-branch/
$ wget https://github.com/JacksonTheMaster/StationeersServerUI/releases/latest/download/StationeersServerUI
```

## üìä Success Rate Prediction

Your chance of successfully running an old branch without modification:
